#' Processing data from Strava dataset

#' @description 
#' This function will process the daily rides dataset files from Strava Metro.

#' @details 
#' The information provided by Strava Metro is a set of directory containing data 
#' about all rides in hourly, daily and monthly period.
#'  This function is aimed to
#' be used with daily data, that is, files contained in the 'all_edges_daily_*'
#'  directory.
